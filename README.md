**Pizza Sales Analysis**üçïüìà 

**What‚Äôs this about?**
I analyzed a pizza store‚Äôs sales data to find out what‚Äôs working (and what‚Äôs not!) in their business.
The goal was to uncover insights about sales, popular pizzas, customer preferences, and ordering patterns ‚Äî basically helping them make smarter decisions.

I used **MySQL** to run all the analysis ‚Äî joining tables, crunching numbers, and answering real business questions.

**What I wanted to find out:**
1. How many orders were placed in total?
2. How much revenue did the store make overall?
3. Which pizza sizes and categories are the most popular?
4. Which pizzas bring in the most revenue?
5. When are the busiest times of the day for orders?
6. What‚Äôs the average number of pizzas sold per day?
7. How much does each category contribute to total revenue?
8. How does revenue grow over time?

**What I discovered:**
**Orders & Revenue**
Total orders and sales revenue calculated to see overall business health.

**Top Pizzas & Categories**
Medium and large pizzas are the crowd favorites.
Some premium pizzas sell less but make more money.
Top 5 most-ordered pizzas and top 3 by revenue stand out clearly.

**Timing**
Lunch and dinner are the busiest hours ‚Äî makes sense, right?
Daily sales are steady with peaks during the weekdays.

**How I did it:**
Used MySQL for all queries.
Combined data from 4 tables: orders, order details, pizzas, and pizza types.
Wrote 13+ queries using joins, aggregations, subqueries, and even some advanced stuff like RANK() and SUM() OVER().

**Why it matters:**
This project shows how even simple data can tell a big story.
By analyzing what customers buy, when they buy it, and which products make the most money, a pizza store (or any business) can plan better and grow smarter.
